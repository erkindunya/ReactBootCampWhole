# ReactJS Facebook messenger

The goals of this exercise are to learn how to use a declarative routing using React Router v4, and learn how to fetch data into your components.

## To get started

### Step 1

If you haven't already set up your project, head here and follow the instructions https://github.com/leanjscom/fb-messenger/blob/master/README.md


### Step 2
```sh
 git checkout react-router
 ``` 
 
### Step 3
```sh
 npm i
 ```

## Exercise

1. Implement the following route [http://localhost:3000/profile](http://localhost:3000/profile) so it renders src/components/Profile.js. Hint, you need to edit 2 files:
    1. One file is the one where you define the /profile &lt;Route&gt;. Which file is that? Hint, think of the component tree and which component should be the parent of &lt;Profile&gt;. [Route documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route)
    2. The second file is src/components/Layout/TopBar.js, edit the &lt;Link&gt; so when the user clicks on the Link it navigates to /profile. [Link documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link)
2. Add a Link component in Profile.js to the path "/messages". Why do you think &lt;Link&gt; is better than &lt;a&gt;? Hint. Look at the network tab in the Chrome Dev Tools and navigate from one page to the other using &lt;Link&gt; and then using &lt;a&gt;
3. The NotFound component should be displayed when no path matches in &lt;App&gt;. Example, navigating to [http://localhost:3000/bla-bla-bla](http://localhost:3000/bla-bla-bla) should display NotFound.js. Hint: [https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/no-match](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/no-match)
4. Refactor the Treads component so it implements the [container component pattern](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005). You have a ThreadsContainer file with some comments and tips. Hint: You will also have to edit the import in src/components/Messenger/index.js
5. Refactor the Conversation component so it implements the [container component pattern](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005). You have a ConversationContainer file with some comments and tips. Hint: You will also have to edit the import in src/components/Messenger/index.js
6. Move the logic on lines 36-44 of Conversation.js to the componentDidUpdate() lifecycle method in ConversationContainer.js. Why do you think [componentDidUpdate](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate) is a better place?
7. In the following url [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login), the src/component/Login.js should not display the &lt;TopBar&gt; and &lt;Footer&gt;. HINT: Why not try moving the Login component up the tree.
8. Display the number of messages in the ConversationBar.

### Bonus
- Refactor as many components as you can into stateless components, meaning using functions instead of classes to define the component.
- Given this component &lt;Route path="/messages/:username" etc &gt; in src/components/Messenger/index, how can we replace the hardcoded string "/messages" in the path by a variable so we can move that Route in the component tree and the parent path of the Route is set dynamically? Hint, look at the Link component in src/components/Messenger/Conversation/ConversationBar.
- The path /messages/:username/detail should display the UserDetail of a Conversation. The path /messages/:username should not display the UserDetail of a Conversation. You can navigate to /messages/:username/detail by clicking on the Link component in src/components/Messenger/Conversation/ConversationBar
- [http://localhost:3000/messages](http://localhost:3000/messages) should not take 100% of the width of the screen. It should take the same width as when there is a Conversation selected. Hint, move the &lt;Route&gt; to the Conversation inside &lt;ConversationSection&gt;
- Add prop-types to all the components that need it.
