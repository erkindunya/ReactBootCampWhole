# ReactJS Facebook messenger

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use Redux in a React app.

## To get started

### Step 1

If you haven't already set up your project, head here and follow the instructions https://github.com/leanjscom/fb-messenger/blob/master/README.md


### Step 2
```sh
 git checkout redux
 ```

### Step 3
```sh
 npm i
 ```

## Exercise

1. Create a logger middleware to log in the console every action that is dispatched

2. Follow the next steps:
  - `git checkout advanced-redux-part2`
  - When you run `yarn start` you'll get the following error: "Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions." To fix it you must create a thunk middleware in store/index.js.
  - When your thunk middleware works you should see the list of Threads on http://localhost:300X/messages

3. Refactor your logger and thunk middleware so you can use them along with `{ applyMiddleware } from 'redux'` in the createStore function

4. In configureStore.dev.js, replace the addLoggerMiddleware and addPromiseSupportToDispatch that you've created with the ones in npm: `redux-logger` and `redux-thunk`. Note, we already did `yarn add redux-logger` and `yarn add redux-thunk`.

5. Steps before you do this task: 1) checkout https://github.com/leanjscom/fb-messenger/tree/advanced-redux-part5, 2) npm stop && npm start. Using thunks, add loading indicators to fetch the conversation you have to:
  - Implement the fetchConversation defined in actions/conversation.js. Hint, you need to copy & paste the logic defined in the method called "fetchConversation" in Messenger/ConversationContainer.js. Then refactor those "props"
  - Dispatch the fetchConversation action in Messenger/ConversationContainer.js instead of receiveConversation & loadingConversation.

6. use reselect to implement a conversation selector
